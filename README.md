# Predicting Maize Hybrid Performance with Machine Learning and a Locus-Specific Degree of Dominance Transformation
  The assessment of the real maize population focused on their performance across several traits, including test weight (kg/mÂ³), ear height (cm), plant height (cm), days after pollination for pollen (Pollen DAP), days after pollination for silk (Silk DAP), and grain moisture. This evaluation aimed to encompass a range of diverse genetic architectures. The results show that the transformation with dominance effects did not improve ML methods. While ML models performed better than the GBLUP model with additive effects only and the GBLUP model including additive and dominance effects, the GBLUP Transformed model outperformed all others, including ML models across the three levels of heritability in the polygenic scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of genomic prediction with transformed GBLUP for polygenic traits. This cannot be said for oligogenic scenarios, as ML models outperformed all other models in oligogenic scenarios. Our findings contribute to optimizing breeding strategies and advancing genomic prediction methodologies.
# 1. Introduction
The genetic architecture of a trait plays a vital role in the predictive ability of genomic models. While classical models like genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) dominate plant breeding, machine learning (ML) methods are gaining traction for their superior handling of non-linear effects.

This study assessed two models integrating ML and classical statistical methods, incorporating a novel locus-specific weighted dominance effect transformation matrix for genomic prediction in hybrid maize.

A total of five models were compared: 
(1) XGBoost combined with locus-specific weighted dominance effects, 
(2) XGBoost only, 
(3) GBLUP model with additive effects only, 
(4) GBLUP model, including additive and dominance effects, 
(5) GBLUP combined with locus-specific weighted dominance effects.

The models were evaluated using two simulated maize populations (one polygenic scenario and the other, an oligogenic scenario; in both scenarios, the dominance varied from 0% to 40%) and a real maize hybrid population (G2F data (2018 - 2021)). Below is a step-by-step process for all the analyses on the G2F data with the Yield trait.

We start with the #Genotype analysis.
Then, the #Phenotype analysis.
